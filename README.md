#Constants checksum

A silly little program which takes your name, gets each letter of your name as a physical constant and multiplies it, generating a very bad checksum for each name.

#Usage

Run:
`g++ -Werror -Wall -Wextra -g -o main constants_checksum.cpp`
`./main`

Input your name, then input the flags you want, for example:
- Threat lowercase/uppercase characters differently
- Threat letters as greek
